                        <div class="news-subject">
                            NASA scientists have noted that Earth's rotation occasionally fluctuates due to events like natural disasters and the influence of the moon.
                        </div>
                        <div class="news-body">
                            <p>
                                The Three Gorges Dam, built across the Yangtze River in Hubei province, was first proposed in 1919 by Sun Yat-sen, the provisional first president of the Republic of China, as a measure to control the Yangtze River's flooding and to symbolise China's might. While it took decades to construct the dam, many media reports have claimed that it has an effect on the Earth's rotation. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Is it really altering the Earth's rotation? Reports indicate that the dam holds water at a level 175 meters above sea level, with a weight exceeding 39 trillion kilograms. This massive weight affects the Earth's rotation due to the moment of inertia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In simple terms, the farther a mass is from its axis, the higher its moment of inertia, which in turn slows the rotational speed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What is 'moment of inertia'? It is "a quantity expressing a body's tendency to resist angular acceleration, which is the sum of the products of the mass of each particle in the body with the square of its distance from the axis of rotation."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Medium reported that the huge mass of the water above sea level does increase the moment of inertia of our Earth but the change in its rotation is as little as 0.06 microseconds. That is to say, we have days that are only 0.06 microseconds longer now.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The dam had some positive effects, such as controlling flooding and generating massive amounts of power. However, 1.2 million people were forced to relocate for its construction. Erosion of the reservoir has impacted thousands of insect and fish species living in its waters. Additionally, the cost of building the dam is estimated to be a staggering $25 billion, with some estimates reaching as high as $37 billion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To conclude, NASA scientists have noted that Earth's rotation occasionally fluctuates due to events like natural disasters and the influence of the moon. Therefore, the change caused by the dam is relatively insignificant in the larger scheme of things. However, we cannot overlook the fact that the Three Gorges Dam is the only man-made object to date with the capacity to singularly affect Earth's rotation.

                                Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea: Papua New Guinea authorities have warned there is a high risk of more landslides at the site of a recent deadly disaster, with government experts demanding the area be evacuated and declared a "no-go zone".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A draft internal report by Papua New Guinea's mining and geohazards department, obtained by AFP on Tuesday, warns that the highland community where hundreds are feared to have died on May 24 needs to be urgently cleared of people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "This area has to be declared a no-go-zone," the report warns, citing a litany of risks from further landslips, teetering boulders and underground streams.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Stating that there is a "high likelihood of further landslides to occur in the immediate future", the report concludes that "any access to the area should be restricted to experts".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rescue workers have already given up on finding any survivors in the 600 metre-long (1,970 feet) scar of soil, boulders and debris left by the landslide on Mount Mungalo, in central Papua New Guinea.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But 12 days after the disaster, locals are still digging through deep mud and hauling rocks in the hope of finding loved ones.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, geologists and other government experts are warning the recovery efforts could provoke another landslide, and the relocation of villagers should be "non-negotiable".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In particular, there is concern that the use of recently arrived heavy machinery could topple boulders perched above.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Movement or vibration from the machinery will set these boulders into motion," the report warns.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Local authorities estimate that 7,849 people live in two wards that were hit by the disaster.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An order to move them on would be fraught.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Local customs place great importance on recovering the bodies, and the area is prone to inter-tribal violence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Any order to evacuate would be "highly sensitive and complex", according to Justine McMahon from CARE Papua New Guinea.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Because not only of people's connection to country (land) but also because new people moving in has an impact on local dynamics," she said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Initial Papua New Guinea government estimates said as many as 2,000 people may have been buried last month, although local officials have more recently put the number in the hundreds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Only nine bodies have been recovered, according to local health authorities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Aid agencies have set up several tents around the landslide site to deliver first aid and food.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But full-scale rescue and relief efforts have been severely hampered by the site's remote location, nearby tribal violence and landslide damage that has severed major road links.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                CARE's McMahon told AFP supplies were slowly making their way to the site, but concerns remained about ensuring access to clean and safe water.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Water is a big concern because the landslide covered the communities' main water source," she said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Papua New Guinea is one of the world's most disaster-prone regions and landslides are extremely common in its highlands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The government report, dated June 3, was carried out by a team of geologists, geo-engineers and geohazards experts.

                            For five days now those that survived have been using shovels and bare hands to dig through mud and debris almost two storeys high.

                        <div class="news-body">
                            Sydney, Australia: Families in Yambali village in Papua New Guinea were sleeping peacefully in their beds when a "mountain" of rubble buried them alive in a gigantic landslide, said a U.N. rescue worker at the disaster site and the country's prime minister.
For five days now those that survived have been using shovels and bare hands to dig through mud and debris almost two storeys high, and covering three to four football fields in area, which has buried an estimated 2,000 people.

Rescue officials say chances of finding survivors are slim.

"It's basically a mountain that has fallen on their heads," said Mate Bagossy, who is with the United Nations Development Programme helping relief efforts in remote Yambali in the northern Enga Province.

Estimates of the death count have varied vastly with the government saying more than 2,000 were buried alive, while the UN estimates about 670 are missing. Community leaders have put the figure at around 200. Only six bodies have been recovered.

"Our people in that village went to sleep for the last time, not knowing they would breathe their last breath as they were sleeping peacefully," Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape told parliament on Wednesday.

"Nature threw a disastrous landslip, submerged or covered the village," Marape said.

The prime minister blamed "extraordinary rainfall" and changes to weather patterns for the landslide and multiple disasters that have hit the Pacific Island nation this year.

Satellite images and pictures from the UN team and local villagers give a sense of the scale of Friday's landslide.

"It's an entire village and shops and a fuel station and a lodge and the church and the school ... all of that has gone," said Bagossy, one of the first of few foreign aid workers to arrive at the village earlier this week.

There is at least six to eight metres (20-26 feet) of rubble covering the area, he said, adding the village lodge was partly visible because the landslide only covered a portion.

"But everything else is under the rubble," he said.

Sadly, Bagossy conceded the chances of finding survivors was nearly zero.

Only one excavator has arrived at the location but is not being used due to concerns that the land is still unstable. Thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate amid further earth slips in the mountain.

Geologists and geo-hazard specialists from Australia and New Zealand are on their way to the village to make an urgent assessment.

"The entire area needs to be surveyed to understand the risk of further landslide in the area and surroundings. It's very complicated to bring in heavy machinery if the terrain is not stable. The entire road was sinking," Bagossy said.

The U.N. migration agency has warned of the risk of infectious diseases due to decaying bodies.

"Every passing minute, bodies buried under the debris are decaying, with water squeezed between the ground and the vast debris covering an area of three to four football fields is continuing to leak, this is posing a high health risk," Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the agency's mission in Papua New Guinea said in an emailed statement.

                            Dhaka: The death count from a cyclone that smashed into low-lying areas of Bangladesh has risen to at least 10 people, with more than 30,000 homes destroyed and tens of thousands more damaged, top local officials said Monday. 

                            "They mostly died after they were crushed under fallen houses or collapsed walls," said Showkat Ali, government administrator of Barisal district, where seven people died.

Three others died in neighbouring districts, some by drowning.

Fierce gales and crashing waves battered the coast as Cyclone Remal made landfall on Sunday night.

By Monday afternoon, it had weakened into a storm, but winds and rain still lashed the coast.

"Heavy rains unleashed by the cyclone are going on, and the wind speed is also high," Ali added.

In Khulan district, two people died, government administrator Helal Mahmud told AFP.

"The cyclone has damaged more than 123,000 homes in the division, and among them some 31,000 homes were completely damaged," he said. 

Another person died in Chittagong, where "more than 40,000 people are still in cyclone shelters due to heavy rains and strong wind", administrator Tofael Islam told AFP. 

Power was knocked out to more than 12.5 million people, said Biswanath Sikder, chief engineer of the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board, the country's largest state-run power distribution company

"We will resume power supply after the cyclone situation improves," he said.

                            Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea: A massive landslide struck Papua New Guinea's highlands Friday, local officials and aid groups said, with many feared dead.
The disaster hit in Kaokalam village, in Papua New Guinea's remote Enga province at around 3:00 am local time.

Provincial governor Peter Ipatas told AFP that a big landslide had caused "loss of life and property".

Images from the scene showed a vast bite of rock and soil cleaved off from a densely vegetated hill.

A long and wide scar of car-size boulders, felled trees and dirt stretched down toward the valley floor.

The remains of many corrugated tin shelters could be seen at the foot of a large landslide.

Dozens of local men and women scrambled over the piles of rock and soil, digging, crying out, listening for survivors or standing scanning the scene in disbelief.

Some became instant rescuers, donning wellington boots, strapping on head torches, picking up machetes and long-handled axes to help clear the rubble.

As they moved around, children carried on their mother's backs could be heard crying.

"The landslide hit around three last night and it looks like more than 100 houses got buried. It is not yet known how many people were in those houses," Vincent Pyati, president of the local Community Development Association, told AFP.

"The number of victims is unknown."

Aid agencies including the Papua New Guinea Red Cross and CARE said they had received confirmation of the landslide, but were working to find out more.

Sitting just south of the equator, the area gets frequent heavy rains.

This year has seen intense rainfall and flooding.

In March, at least 23 people were killed by a landslide in a nearby province.

The Australian government said it was "making enquiries with local authorities to determine whether any Australian have been affected."

"The Australian Government offers its sympathies to those affected by landslides in Papua New Guinea."
